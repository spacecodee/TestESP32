# This is a project to test a ESP32

- This project is a simple project to test the ESP32
- I'm using CLion to develop this project
- I'm Using PlatformIO to develop this project

## If you want to test this project you must have a ESP32 and do the next things:

1. Install PlatformIO
2. Clone this project
3. Open the project with CLion or your favorite IDE, but if you aren't going to use CLion I recommend you to use
   PlatformIO IDE (Visual Studio Code based)
4. Set your Wi-Fi credentials in the `store_credentials.cpp` file
5. Compile and upload the code to your ESP32
6. You must first compile the `[env:store_credentials]` environment and then compile the `[env:esp32dev]` environment
7. You must have to be connected to the same network as the ESP32
8. Then, enjoy the project and make your own changes
